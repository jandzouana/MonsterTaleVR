# Monster Tale VR

## Description
A quick interactive Virtual Reality experience I have designed in Unity. Initially this project was designed for Cardboard, but it has been modified to run on Google Daydream. It is based on an [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4El3XyjnP_M)
I have created in 2015.
