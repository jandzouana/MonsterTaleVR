# Monster Tale VR

## Description
A quick interactive Virtual Reality experience I have designed in Unity. It is based on an [animation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4El3XyjnP_M)
I have created in 2015.

## Built With

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) - Game engine used
* [Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) - 3D modelling program used

## Instructions
You will need either Unity Daydream Preview, or Unity 5.6x. Additionally, you will need an android phone with a gyroscope running KitKat or above. The phone will be used to emulate the Daydream controller. Click
[here](https://developers.google.com/vr/daydream/controller-emulator)
and follow the directions to setup the controller emulator.
Once you are done, open Unity, and open Monster Tale (inside MonsterTaleVR) as a project. Click play and interact with the environment using the controller emulator.
